## Imagine With Us

Your pocket creative studio inside Farcaster/Base App.

Turn your ideas into images, videos, and music with a simple prompt. Approve a small, upfront payment for each creation and we’ll handle the rest—no subscriptions, no setup.

### What you can create

- **Images:** Posters, album covers, concept art, social graphics
- **Videos:** Short clips, motion visuals, storyboards
- **Music:** Melodies, soundtracks, or songs from prompts and optional lyrics

### How it works

1. Open the Mini App in the Base App or Farcaster (so your wallet is ready).
2. Write your prompt (add lyrics if you’re making music).
3. Choose what to make: image, video, or music.
4. Review the price and approve the payment on Base.
5. Watch the progress; your result appears when it’s ready. Download or share instantly.

### Pricing & payments

- **Pay per creation:** Only pay when you make something.
- **Clear pricing:** See the price before you approve.
- **On Base:** Payments happen on the Base network using crypto.
- **Private & secure:** Approvals happen in your Base/Farcaster app; we don’t post without your action.

### Tips for better results

- Be specific about subject, style, and mood.
- Name the medium (e.g., “watercolor poster”, “cinematic trailer”, “ambient piano”).
- For music, add a short lyric or theme to guide the vibe.
- If the first result isn’t perfect, tweak and try again.
