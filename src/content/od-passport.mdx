## OD Passport

OD Passport is a web app that lets users view and manage their onchain badges issued as EAS (Ethereum Attestation Service) attestations. Each badge follows a custom schema, which can be defined or reused by admins to represent attendance at events or onchain achievements.

### Admin Features

- Define new badge schemas or reuse existing ones
- Issue badges to users based on event participation or onchain actions
- Reissue or revoke badges as needed
- All admin actions are secured and executed via Safe multisig integration

### User Experience

- View all badges owned in a single dashboard
- Explore badge details and see other collectors
- Transparent, onchain record of achievements and participation

OD Passport brings together identity, community, and onchain reputation, making it easy to issue, manage, and showcase verifiable badges.
